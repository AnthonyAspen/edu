The decision tree model stands out as the top performer across multiple metrics,
including AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1 score, precision (Prec), recall, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and log loss.

Both LR Ridge and LR Lasso logistic regression models demonstrate competitive performance.

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) models, regardless of the number of neighbors, exhibit poor performance on this dataset.
